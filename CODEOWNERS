# @file: CODEOWNERS
# @from: https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners#codeowners-file-location example

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, both
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 would be requested for
# review when anyone else opens a pull request.
# This is one way, though it has pitfalls, of designating a rotating 'repo-reviewer'.
# But this rule is commented out:
# * @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies Python Notebook files, only @dmsj and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.ipynb    @sprax

# Any change to a CMake file requires a review from @sprax
# This catches the CMakeLists.txt in the root directory and under /externals.
CMake*.txt @sprax

# In this example, @sprax owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository.
/docs/ @sprax

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# So files in the top-level docs dir must be reviewed by the following:
docs/*  @sprax

# Any change under any directory ending in `_app` will trigger a review from @sprax
*_app/ @sprax
